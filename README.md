Office Network Simulation with EIGRP Routing Protocol using Cisco Packet Tracer

üè¢ Project Description
This project simulates a fully connected office network infrastructure using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network is designed to demonstrate the configuration and working of the EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol), providing dynamic routing between multiple routers.

The simulation includes multiple departments/subnets, basic switch and router configurations, IP addressing, and routing to allow seamless communication within the office network.

üéØ Objectives
Design an office LAN environment.

Implement inter-router communication using EIGRP.

Assign IP addresses and subnetting for different departments.

Ensure all devices across subnets can communicate.

Validate configurations through ping and routing table checks.

üß∞ Tools Used
Cisco Packet Tracer

Networking Devices:

Routers (e.g., 2911)

Switches (e.g., 2960)

PCs (Office clients)

Protocols: EIGRP (Dynamic Routing)

üóÇÔ∏è Network Topology Summary
Routers: Interconnected using serial links.

Switches: Provide local connectivity to PCs in each subnet.

IP Addressing: Subnetted IPv4 address space.

Routing Protocol: EIGRP configured with autonomous system number and appropriate networks advertised.

Devices Configured:

Router Interfaces with IPs

EIGRP on all routers

End devices with gateway IPs

Switches for each subnet

‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Highlights
Example EIGRP Configuration:

bash
Copy
Edit
router eigrp 10
  network 192.168.1.0
  network 192.168.2.0
  no auto-summary
IP Configuration for PCs:

IP: 192.168.x.x

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Gateway: Corresponding router interface

‚úÖ How to Run
Open the Eigrp lab.pkt file in Cisco Packet Tracer.

Verify router configurations using the CLI.

Ping between end devices in different subnets.

Use show ip route to inspect the EIGRP routing table.

üß™ Test Cases
 All PCs should ping each other.

 EIGRP neighbors should be visible with show ip eigrp neighbors.

 Routing tables should reflect correct learned routes.

üìö Learning Outcomes
Hands-on experience in EIGRP configuration.

Understanding of dynamic routing.

IP addressing and subnet planning.

Practical use of Cisco Packet Tracer for network design.
